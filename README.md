# Covid-19 Data Representation
This is a project built to represent the COVID-19 data. The data is fetched using the "Covid Tracking Project" API. The endpoint used is "https://api.covidtracking.com/v1/states/current.json". 
I have used "Streamlit" library to create an interactive application for the data representation. Since, I have written this code using Colab, I had to use Ngrok to connect to my local machine server.

I have used the following libraries in this project:
- Streamlit: Used to create interactive application in python
- Plotly: To create beautiful graphs
- Numpy & Pandas: For data storage and use
- Requests: Used to make Http calls easily
- Json: Used to parse json data in Python
